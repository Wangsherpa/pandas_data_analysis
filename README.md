# Sales Analysis Using Pandas, Numpy & Matplotlib

#### In this task we use Python Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questionsabout 1 year(2019) of sales data. The data contains thousands of store purchases broken down by date and time of purchase, product name, price, address, etc.

#### We have answered the following quesitons through our data analysis mainly using pandas and matplotlib library.
    Q1. What was the best month for sales?
    Q2. What city has the highest number of sales?
    Q3. What time should we display advertisements to maximize likelihood of customers buying product?
    Q4. What products are most often sold together?
    Q5. What product sold the most and why?

#### To answer these questions we walk through many different pandas & matplotlib library methods:
- Converting all separate data (monthly data) to a single csv file.
- Adding columns
- Parsing cells as strings to make new columns
- Using pandas DataFrame.apply() method
- Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
- Plotting bar charts and line graphs to visualize our results
